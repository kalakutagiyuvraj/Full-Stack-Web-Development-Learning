    <h1>Image Tag & Its Attributes</h1>
    <pre>
    <img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="image1" width="300">

    This line uses the HTML &lt;img> tag to display an image on a web page. Here’s a breakdown of each attribute:

    src="images/img1.jpg": Specifies the path to the image file. In this case, it looks for img1.jpg inside the images
    folder relative to the HTML file.
    alt="image1": Provides alternative text that describes the image. This text is shown if the image fails to load and
    is also used by screen readers for accessibility.
    width="300": Sets the displayed width of the image to 300 pixels. The browser will scale the image to this width.

    If the image path is incorrect, the browser will show the alt text instead.
    Setting only the width (without height) keeps the image’s aspect ratio, but if you set both, the image may appear
    stretched.
    Example: This tag will show a 300-pixel wide image called img1.jpg and display "image1" if the image can’t be
    loaded.

    <img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="image2" height="300">
    
    height="300": Sets the displayed height of the image to 300 pixels. The browser will scale the image to this height.
   </pre>
   <pre>
