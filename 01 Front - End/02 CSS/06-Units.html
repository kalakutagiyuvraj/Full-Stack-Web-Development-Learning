        <h1>🔹 What are CSS Units? </h1>
        CSS units define the measurement of values like length, size, spacing, positioning, etc. They tell the browser
        how much or how big something should be.
        Units are mainly divided into two categories:
        Absolute Units → Fixed values that do not change depending on screen size.
        Relative Units → Flexible values that depend on parent element, root element, or viewport.

        🔹 Types of CSS Units
        1. Absolute Units (fixed measurements, don’t scale with screen size)
        px → Pixels, smallest unit on screen.
        pt → Points, traditionally used in print (1pt = 1/72 inch).
        pc → Picas, used in typography (1pc = 12pt).
        in → Inches (1in = 96px).
        cm → Centimeters.
        mm → Millimeters

        2. Relative Units (scale depending on environment)
        a) Font-relative units
        em → Relative to the font size of the element.
        rem → Relative to the font size of the root element (usually <html>).
        ex → Relative to the height of the lowercase "x" of the font.
        ch → Relative to the width of the character "0" (zero) of the font.

        b) Viewport-relative units
        vw → Relative to 1% of the viewport width.
        vh → Relative to 1% of the viewport height.
        vmin → Relative to 1% of the smaller dimension (width or height).
        vmax → Relative to 1% of the larger dimension (width or height).
        svw, svh → Small viewport width/height (mobile friendly).
        lvw, lvh → Large viewport width/height.
        dvw, dvh → Dynamic viewport width/height (accounts for browser UI changes).
        c) Container-relative units (CSS Containment Module, modern CSS)
        cqw, cqh → Relative to 1% of container’s width/height.
        cqi, cqb → Relative to 1% of container’s inline/block size.
        cqmin → Relative to the smaller container dimension.
        cqmax → Relative to the larger container dimension.

        3. Percentage (%)
        % → Relative to the parent element’s value (depends on property, e.g., width % depends on parent width,
        font-size % depends on parent font-size).

        4. Angle Units (used in rotation, gradients, etc.)
        deg → Degrees (0–360).
        grad → Gradians (400 units in a full circle).
        rad → Radians (2π radians in a circle).
        turn → Turns (1 turn = full circle).
        5. Time Units (used in animations, transitions)
        s → Seconds.
        ms → Milliseconds.
        6. Frequency Units (rarely used, for speech CSS)
        Hz → Hertz.
        kHz → Kilohertz.
        7. Resolution Units (for media queries, printing)
        dpi → Dots per inch.
        dpcm → Dots per centimeter.
        dppx → Dots per pixel unit (1dppx = 96dpi).
        ✅ So in total, CSS units cover:
        Absolute Lengths (px, pt, pc, in, cm, mm)
        Relative Lengths (em, rem, ex, ch, vw, vh, vmin, vmax, svw, lvw, dvw, cqw, cqmin, etc.)
        Percentage (%)
        Angle Units (deg, rad, grad, turn)
        Time Units (s, ms)
        Frequency Units (Hz, kHz)
        Resolution Units (dpi, dpcm, dppx)
