    ## **1. Grade Calculator**

    Write a program that takes marks (0–100) and prints:

    * **A** → 90–100
    * **B** → 75–89
    * **C** → 50–74
    * **D** → 35–49
    * **Fail** → < 35 Use **if–else if–else**. --- ## 
    
    
    **2. Odd, Even, or Multiple-of-5?** Take a number and print: *
        **Even** * **Odd** * **Multiple of 5** (A number can be both even AND multiple of 5) Use combined logical

    **7. Leap Year Checker** Input: year A year is leap if:
        * divisible by 4 * NOT divisible by 100 * unless also divisible by 400 Use complex logical conditions. --- ##
        
    **8. Electricity Bill Calculator** Input: units * 0–100 → ₹5 per unit * 101–200 → ₹7 per unit * 201–300 → ₹10
        per unit *> 300 → ₹12 per unit

        Use conditions to calculate the final bill.
